Reaction Diffusion model
========================

This is an GPU-implementation of a reaction-diffusion equation based on pyglet.


Numerical simulations of a simple reaction-diffusion model reveal a surprising
variety of irregular spatiotemporal patterns. These patterns arise in response
to finite-amplitude perturbations. Some of them resemble the steady irregular
patterns recently observed in thin gel reactor experiments. Others consist of
spots that grow until they reach a critical size, at which time they divide in
two. If in some region the spots become overcrowded, all of the spots in that
region decay into the uniform background."
